# react-native-indicate

Enhanced ScrollView with elements indicating scrollable overflow.

## Installation

```
npm i react-native-indicate
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from 'react-native'
import Indicate from 'react-native-indicate'

export () =>
    <Indicate>
        <Text>Hello Plugin</Text>
    </Indicate>
```

## Options

By default scrolling is enabled for both directions (horizontal and vertical) if there is overflow. The behaviour of Indicate can further be configured with
the following props.

| Prop                  | Description                                                   | Default | Type    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| horizontal            | Allow horizontal scrolling.                                   | true    | boolean |
| vertical              | Allow vertical scrolling.                                     | true    | boolean |
| fadeWidth             | Width of the fade effect used to indicate overflow.           | 20      | number  |
| appearanceOffset      | In this range scrollable overflow will be ignored.            | 10      | number  |
| wrapperStyle          | Added to the wrapping SafeAreaView component.                 | null    | object  |
| style                 | Styles added to the ScrollView.                               | null    | object  |
| innerViewStyle        | Styles added to the inner ScrollView (both directions).       | null    | object  |
| contentContainerStyle | Passed to the ScrollView as well.                             | null    | object  |
| gradient              | Imported image representing a gradient for the left element.  | null    | number  |
| any                   | All other props passed will be passed down to the ScrollView. | null    | any     |

If you need the gradient colored differently, pass a PNG with height 1 pixel and width matching the fadeWidth as the gradient prop. Same format as would be passed to this: `<Image source={require('../gradient.png')} />`. Support for `react-native-linear-gradient` (which requires native dependencies) is planned.
